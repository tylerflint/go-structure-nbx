## Nanobox Desktop

[Nanobox](https://nanobox.io/) automates the creation of isolated, repeatable environments for local and production applications. When developing locally, Nanobox provisions your app's infrastructure inside of a virtual machine (VM) and mounts your local codebase into the VM. Any changes made to your codebase are reflected inside the virtual environment.

Once code is built and tested locally, Nanobox can be used to provision and deploy an identical infrastructure on a production platform.
