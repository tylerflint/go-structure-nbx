This directory is strictly for generic, reusable packages only. If it is
application specific, it does not belong in here. There should be no stray
golang files in this directory.
Although these could be split out into their own repo's (someday), they may
not be as feature complete as they should be for a general "works for everyone"
package, so we will leave them here until that time.
